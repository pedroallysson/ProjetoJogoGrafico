[u][b]EDITS[/u]
[b]1.  I fixed Scorpion's chaining so now his punches and kicks will not chain into the same button over and over again
2. He can cancel out some super moves like Capcom Vs.Snk characters
3. He has 3 original super moves and one new super move...  Its called [b]"Raging Scorpion"[/b] and also one new special move... [b]"Scorpion Kicks"[/b]
4. I wanted scropion to have a voice so, i gave him a  original voice.. (Yes that's right, its original)
5. I changed his cns so that the ground velocity wouldn't be so high so combos would connect
6. I added sounds to his snd for his punches and kicks and also for his super moves and his voice...
7. I also made it where is is now a full 6 button character, yep no more almost 6 button, he now has moves for all buttons
(Fierce punch = Z    Fierce Kick = c) [b]same thing goes for the air and crouch attacks[/b]

[b]1.  I fixed Subzero's chaining so now his punches and kicks will not chain into the same button over and over again
2. He can cancel out some super moves like Capcom Vs.Snk characters
3. He has 2 old hypers, 3 original super moves, and 1 new hyper... They all include binho's super backgrounds and hit sparks and also blood..  :w00t:
4. I wanted subzero to have a voice so, i gave him a  original voice.. (Yes that's right, its original)  :-@
5. I changed his cns so that the ground velocity wouldn't be so high so combos would connect 
6. I added sounds to his snd for his punches and kicks and also for his super moves and his voice...
7. I also made it where is is now a full 6 button character, yep no more almost 6 button, he now has moves for all buttons  =D>
(Fierce punch = Z    Fierce Kick = c) [b]same thing goes for the air and crouch attacks[/b]

[u][b]2 Old Super Moves, and 3 original moves did by me, and 1 new move[/b][/u]
